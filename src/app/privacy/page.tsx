        </p>

        <h1 className="text-l font-bold mb-1 text-left">1. What We Collect</h1>
        <p className="text-sm text-black text-justify p-5">
        When you’re using our Services, we might collect a few things:     
           
         <h1 className="text-l font-bold mb-1 text-left">Personal Info:</h1>This is the stuff you give us directly—your name, email, address, and phone number when you sign up or get in touch with us.
         
         <h1 className="text-l font-bold mb-1 text-left">Techy Data:</h1>Our servers might collect some info automatically, like your IP address, browser type, and how you interact with our Services. This helps us understand how everything is working!
         
         <h1 className="text-l font-bold mb-1 text-left">Payment Details: </h1>If you’re making a purchase, we’ll need your payment info—like your credit card number and expiration date. Don’t worry; we keep this info safe!
        </p>

        <h1 className="text-l font-bold mb-1 text-left">2. How We Use Your Info </h1>

        <h1 className="text-l font-bold mb-1 text-left">3. Sharing Your Info </h1>
        <p className="text-sm text-black text-justify p-5">
        We know sharing info can feel a bit scary, but we promise we only do it when necessary:
         <h1 className="text-l font-bold mb-1 text-left">Legal Stuff: </h1>If we ever have to comply with the law or protect our rights, we may need to share your info
         <h1 className="text-l font-bold mb-1 text-left">Third-Party Helpers: </h1>We work with some awesome third-party services to help us out, like payment processors and customer support teams. They only get access to what they need to do their jobs.
         <h1 className="text-l font-bold mb-1 text-left">Business Moves: </h1>If we ever merge with or sell to another company, your info might go along for the ride.
        </p>

        <h1 className="text-l font-bold mb-1 text-left">4. Cookies and Tracking </h1>
        <p className="text-sm text-black text-justify p-5">
        We use cookies (not the yummy kind) and similar tech to enhance your experience on our Services. These help us remember you and your preferences, making everything easier.       
        </p>

        <h1 className="text-l font-bold mb-1 text-left">5. Links to Other Sites </h1>
        <p className="text-sm text-black text-justify p-5">
        Our Services may include links to other cool websites and apps. Just a heads up: once you leave Offerboat, we’re not responsible for how those sites handle your information. Always read their privacy policies!       
         </p>

        <h1 className="text-l font-bold mb-1 text-left">6. Keeping Your Info Safe </h1>
        <p className="text-sm text-black text-justify p-5">
        We take security seriously! We use all the right measures to protect your info, but no method is foolproof. While we do our best to keep your data safe, remember that nothing on the internet is 100% secure.         
        </p>

        <h1 className="text-l font-bold mb-1 text-left">7. For the Youngsters</h1>
        <p className="text-sm text-black text-justify p-5">
        We’re not here to collect info from kids under 13. If we find out we’ve collected something from a child without permission, we’ll delete it ASAP
        </p>
